    "Using Sentiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall Sentiment in the small towns is leaning negative (-.014 for JD and -0.04 for Tim Ryan). However in big cities, Tim Ryan seems to have a significant advantage over JD Vance as Ryan has a positive sentiment score of 0.07 compared to Vance's -0.10. \n",
    "We would suggest that JD Vance's campaign investigate why he is viewed negatively in the bigger cities and then focus their campaign efforts on altering the public perception of his candidacy. Of course, this could just be due to his poltical party as Vance is running as a Republican, who traditionally do not do very well in big cities nationwide. \n",
